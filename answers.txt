1. In a non-Agile project, the product owner equivalent would be something like a project manager. In Agile terms, a product owner is important to have because they hold the project together and make everything function. They set the direction for the team, handle the release management, and also manage the stakeholders. 
2. The Scrum Master is responsible for all he scrum related tasks. Setting up meeting times, ensuring communication and collaboration, and facilitating sprints to effectively guide the team using Agile project management is what the Scrum Master is all about. However, a Project Owner is more about the project management side of things. They deal with deadlines, project vision, and providing feedback on product ideas and implementations.
3. There are 3 kinds of meeetings that happen during a sprint cycle. There's a sprint planning meeting where the team determines what needs to be done in the upcoming sprint and also determines individual story point and assigns them to groups. There's a daily scrum/standup meeting where the team discusses what they've accomplished so far and make plans on what they're going to do for the day. Lasly, there's also a Sprint Retrospective meeting that happens at the end of the sprint the work completed during the sprint is discussed and any unresolved issues are moved back to the backlog.
